#ETL Pipeline
* Creating a Python based etl pipeline using the Deutsche BÃ¶rse Public Dataset (PDS). \n
* Raw dataset is stored in a S3 bucket, after extracting and cleaning/ transforming process, desired data is uploaded into a separate S3 bucket for further analysing the data.
* I am initially using a quick Python script utilizing Pandas module to accomplish this. 
* For more information on the dataset, please visit: https://github.com/Deutsche-Boerse/dbg-pds
